The CodeAlpha internship program provides hands-on experience in frontend technologies. During this internship, I worked on real-world projects that strengthened my knowledge of:

HTML5 & Semantic Structure CSS3 (Responsive Design, Animations, Transitions) JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Events, Functions) Git & GitHub for version control Deploying websites on GitHub Pages / Netlify

✅ Internship Tasks I successfully completed the following tasks from the given list :

Task 4: Music Player using JavaScript

This project is a modern, responsive music player developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the CodeAlpha Frontend Development Internship.
It allows users to play, pause, skip, and navigate through songs with a beautiful and interactive interface.

🎧 Overview

The Music Player offers a seamless and engaging user experience with custom-designed controls and dynamic UI updates.
It helps in understanding how JavaScript can be used for handling audio APIs, DOM manipulation, and event listeners effectively.

⚙️ Core Features

▶️ Play / Pause: Easily start or pause the music with one click.
⏭️ Next / Previous: Navigate through the playlist using next and previous buttons.
⏹️ Stop / Restart: Option to restart the current track.
🔊 Volume Control: Adjustable sound control slider.
⏱️ Progress Bar: Shows the current playback position in real time.
⏮️ Seek Functionality: Click on the progress bar to jump to any point in the song.
🎶 Auto-play Next Song: Automatically moves to the next track when one finishes.
💿 Song Details: Displays track name, artist, and album art dynamically.
📱 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

🖥️ UI / UX Highlights

Elegant and minimal glass-morphism design with blur background.
Animated album cover that rotates while the song is playing.
Smooth button transitions and hover effects for modern feel.
Dynamic color themes to match song thumbnails or moods.

💻 Technologies Used

HTML5 → Page structure and audio tag integration.
CSS3 → Styling, gradient effects, animations, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6) → Functional logic for play/pause, seek, playlist, and event handling.

🚀 How It Works

The player loads all songs and cover images dynamically from the playlist.
JavaScript handles the audio object to control play, pause, time updates, and volume.
The progress bar and rotation animation update in real time with the current playback.
When a song ends, it automatically plays the next track in the list.
